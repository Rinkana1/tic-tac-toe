# Tic-Tac-Toe Project
This is a project I did in my senior of high school while taking Computer Science Principles with the PLTW program. It's a very simple 2-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe where player 1 plays as 'X' and player 2 plays as 'O'. Input is giving through the terminal using a coordinate based system that is shown on the game board.

## What I used:
In order to accomplish this, I used Turtle graphics to draw the 'X' and 'O' sprites, as well as the line that's drawn through the winning player's inputs. All input and instructions are given in the terminal.

## Requirements to Run:
In order to run this program, you must have Python 3 and Tkinter installed on your computer. In order to do that, follow these steps:

```bash
# For a Debian or Ubuntu Linux distribution
$ sudo apt-get update # Updates system
$ sudo apt-get install python3.x # Installs Python. Replace the 'x' with the latest version of Python
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk # Installs Tkinter (required for Turtle Graphics)
```
For installation instructions on other operating systems, please refer to Google, though it should be equally as simple.
